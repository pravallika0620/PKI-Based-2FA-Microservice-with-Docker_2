# 🔐 PKI-Based 2FA Microservice with Docker

## Overview
This project implements a secure, containerized authentication microservice using *Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)* and *Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)* two-factor authentication. It demonstrates enterprise-grade security practices including RSA encryption, secure key handling, Docker containerization, persistent storage, and automated cron jobs.

This project was developed as part of the *Partnr Mandatory Task*.

---

## Objective
To build a production-ready microservice that:
- Decrypts a securely encrypted seed using RSA/OAEP
- Generates and verifies TOTP-based 2FA codes
- Persists sensitive data across container restarts
- Logs TOTP codes every minute using cron
- Runs reliably inside a Docker container

---

## Tech Stack
- *Language:* Python 3.11  
- *Framework:* FastAPI  
- *Cryptography:* cryptography (RSA, OAEP, PSS)  
- *2FA:* pyotp (TOTP)  
- *Containerization:* Docker, Docker Compose  
- *Scheduler:* cron  

---

## Security Features
- RSA 4096-bit key pair
- RSA/OAEP (SHA-256) for seed decryption
- RSA-PSS (SHA-256) for commit proof signing
- TOTP (SHA-1, 30-second window, 6-digit codes)
- Time window tolerance (±1 period)
- UTC timezone enforced
